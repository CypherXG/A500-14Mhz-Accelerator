Updated version of the infamous 14Mhz Accelerator by Livio Plos - stackable with the 8MB FastRAM board. 

Yeah i know, there's a load of accelerators out there (the TF520/530/534 by the exceptionally talented Stephen 'TerribleFire' Leary being the most prominent) that are much, much more impressive than this - but this has the following things going for it:

1) It's 100% through hole soldering, no SMT parts - easy for a beginner or for someone with shaky hands like me.
2) It's cheap to build
3) Uses simple logic gates - no fancy-schmancy CPLD/FPGA gubbins ;)
4) It's...err...it's...it's green.

Stacking with the 8MB FastRAM board works a treat although clearance with the top case in an A500 miiiiight be an issue. 

Uses 68HC000 chips, these run a lot cooler than the originals, and can be clocked high, without the need of a heatsink.
